            Software Developer
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to my page. I am a software developer originally from Vienna, Austria now based on the Gold Coast. I have a passion for immersive technologies and digital experiences. Through my previous jobs I was able to collect more than 5 years professional experience in developing digital solutions. 
</p>

<p className='py-2'>I am about to graduate master of Information Technology from Griffith University. As part of this degree I had the chance to complete a work integrated learning placement with fluxguide. Fluxguide is an early adopter of augmented reality for the cultural heritage industry. I was delighted that I had the chance during my placement to develop prototypes for the brand new Apple Vision Pro headset that is revolutionising the mixed reality space. Checkout some of my mixed reality projects on my YouTube channel.</p>

<p>During my placement with fluxguide I also developed a full-fledged web-platform with the new Next.js framework and a underlying database.</p>

<p className='py-2'>Now, after my placement and my soon graduation, I am looking for an interesting opportunity to apply my skills as a software developer. In my next endeavour I am looking to build on the state-of-the-art web development and augmented reality skills I developed through my work for fluxguide.
</p>

<p className='py-4'>In the long run, I want to establish myself as an internationally sought after industry expert for 3D- and augmented reality software development.
