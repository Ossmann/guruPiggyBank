            Software Developer
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to my page. I am a software developer originally from Vienna, Austria now based on the Gold Coast. I have a passion for immersive technologies and digital experiences. Through my previous jobs I was able to collect more than 5 years professional experience in developing digital solutions. 
</p>

<p className='py-2'>I graduated from Griffith University, Master of Information Technology.</p>

<p className='py-2'>I am always looking for interesting opportunities to apply my skills as a software developer. In my next endeavour I am looking to build on the state-of-the-art web development and augmented reality skills I developed through my work and studies.
</p>

<p className='py-4'>In the long run, I want to establish myself as an internationally sought after industry expert for 3D- and augmented reality software development.
